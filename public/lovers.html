    <p>I could say that she was my "first love" although i did'nt really felt so much love from her. We only lasted 1 month :) . From this relationship, I atleast got a little more fame at school because she was one of the member of the student council. From her, I learned that I don't need to rush on making decisions and I should've wait to check on the situations. Thank you, Naj </p>

        My first "real" relationship. There's so many things that I could talk about her and i prefer not to. She's like the rainbow after a rain, like an oasis at the desert, like a gas station in the middle of nowhere, like a sunrise after a long night, like a butterfly that blurs your sight from the rest of the world, and I could go on and on and on talking about her. We lasted about 8 months. It ended because of external circumstances.

        Seeing her with a new boy made my heart break. I could spend an hour thinking about what we could've been. I learned that sometimes things won't always go the way I want it to go. Thank you, yya.
